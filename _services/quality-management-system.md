# Developing New QMS or Updating Existing Systems

We assist organizations in developing new QMS or updating existing systems to meet the dynamic regulatory landscape. Our services include:

- **Gap Analysis**: We conduct a comprehensive assessment of your current QMS to identify gaps and areas that need improvement to align with the latest regulatory requirements.

- **QMS Design and Implementation**: We work closely with your team to design and implement a QMS that is tailored to your organization's specific needs, considering factors such as size, complexity, and regulatory environment.

- **Process Standardization**: We help standardize processes and procedures across your organization to ensure consistency and efficiency in quality management practices.

# Compliance with Regulatory Standards

Staying compliant with regulatory standards is crucial for medical device manufacturers. Our QMS solutions are designed to meet the requirements of key standards, including:

- **ISO 13485**: We ensure that your QMS aligns with ISO 13485, the international standard for medical device quality management systems. This standard emphasizes risk management, regulatory compliance, and the ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of the QMS.

- **IEC 62304**: For software-intensive medical devices, we incorporate the requirements of IEC 62304, which focuses on the software development life cycle and software risk management.

- **ISO 14971**: We address the requirements of ISO 14971, the standard for medical device risk management, to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout the product lifecycle.

- **FDA 21 CFR Part 820**: We ensure compliance with FDA regulations, specifically 21 CFR Part 820, which outlines the quality system requirements for medical device manufacturers in the United States.

- **EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR)**: We assist organizations in aligning their QMS with the EU MDR, ensuring compliance with the updated regulations for medical devices marketed within the European Union.

- **IEC 60601**: For medical electrical equipment, we incorporate the requirements of IEC 60601, which focuses on the safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment.

# Lightweight and Agile QMS Solutions

We understand the importance of agility and efficiency in QMS. Our approach emphasizes lightweight solutions while ensuring full compliance with regulatory requirements. We focus on:

- **Risk-Based Approach**: We help organizations implement a risk-based approach to quality management, ensuring that resources are allocated based on the level of risk associated with different processes and activities.

- **Streamlined Documentation**: We optimize documentation processes to minimize bureaucracy and reduce the burden of paperwork, while still meeting the necessary documentation requirements.

- **Agile QMS Implementation**: We introduce agile methodologies and tools to enable faster decision-making, responsiveness to changes, and continuous improvement within the QMS.

# Cyber Security, Safety, and Risk Management

In today's interconnected world, cyber security is a critical aspect of medical device quality management. We offer expertise in:

- **Cyber Security Risk Assessment**: We assess the cyber security risks associated with your medical device systems and provide recommendations for effective risk management strategies.

- **Safety and Risk Management**: Our experts assist in integrating safety and risk management practices into your QMS, ensuring that potential risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the product lifecycle.

# Continuous Improvement and Training

Continuous improvement is key to maintaining an effective QMS. We offer:
